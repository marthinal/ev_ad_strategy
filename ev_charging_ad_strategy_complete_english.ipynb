    "## 1. Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "This comprehensive analysis presents a data-driven approach to optimizing advertising strategy at electric vehicle (EV) charging stations. As the EV market continues to expand, charging stations represent unique advertising opportunities where users spend extended periods during the charging process.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Business Context and Problem Statement\n",
    "\n",
    "Electric vehicle charging stations are strategic points where users spend significant time during the charging process, making them ideal locations for displaying personalized and relevant advertisements. Unlike traditional gas stations where refueling takes minutes, EV charging can take 30 minutes to several hours, creating a captive audience with extended dwell times.\n",
    "\n",
    "The key challenge is to **optimize the advertising strategy by identifying user behavior patterns** and determining the optimal moments for displaying different types of advertisements to maximize campaign impact.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Main Hypothesis\n",
    "\n",
    "**Primary Hypothesis:** Charging patterns vary according to user type and vehicle characteristics, allowing identification of optimal moments for different types of advertisements.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Specific Hypotheses:**\n",
    "1. **Large Charge Users:** Long-distance travelers who charge during early morning hours are more receptive to hotel or restaurant advertisements\n",
    "2. **Small Charge Users:** Urban drivers who charge during daytime hours are more receptive to café or quick service advertisements\n",
    "\n",
    "### Project Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "**General Objective:** Develop an analysis and prediction system to maximize advertising impact at charging stations\n",
    "\n",
    "**Specific Objectives:**\n",
    "1. Design a predictive model to identify optimal moments for advertising display\n",
    "2. Create user segmentation based on charging behavior patterns\n",
    "3. Provide actionable recommendations for targeted advertising strategies\n",
    "4. Establish a scalable framework for incorporating future variables\n",
    "\n",
    "### Methodology\n",
    "\n",
    "This analysis follows the **CRISP-DM (Cross-Industry Standard Process for Data Mining)** methodology:\n",
    "- **Business Understanding:** Define objectives and requirements\n",
    "- **Data Understanding:** Explore and assess data quality\n",
    "- **Data Preparation:** Clean and transform data for analysis\n",
    "- **Modeling:** Apply clustering and predictive techniques\n",
    "- **Evaluation:** Assess model performance and business value\n",
    "- **Deployment:** Provide implementation recommendations"

    "\n",

    "### 3.4 Variable Selection and Justification\n",
    "\n",
    "Based on our business objectives and data quality assessment, we'll focus on the following key variables:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Selected Variables for Analysis:**\n",
    "1. **User.Type:** Essential for identifying long-distance travelers (primary target for hotel ads)\n",
    "2. **End_Day (Day of Week):** Determines high-traffic days for optimal ad scheduling\n",
    "3. **Charging.Station.Location:** Enables location-based ad segmentation\n",
    "4. **Charging.End.Time:** Identifies optimal time windows for ad display\n",
    "5. **Charger.Type:** Helps estimate average charging time and user behavior\n",
    "\n",
    "**Justification for Variable Selection:**\n",
    "- These variables have **no missing values** or significant data quality issues\n",
    "- They directly relate to our **advertising optimization objectives**\n",
    "- They enable **practical business applications** for targeted advertising\n",
    "\n",
    "**Justification for Using Charging End Time Instead of Start Time:**\n",
    "We chose `Charging.End.Time` over `Charging.Start.Time` because:\n",
    "- Start times follow artificial patterns (hourly increments)\n",
    "- End times appear more realistic and reliable for analysis\n",
    "- End times better represent when users are available for ad engagement\n",
    "\n",
    "**Justification for Not Removing Missing Values and Outliers:**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Missing Values:**\n",
    "- Our analysis focuses on variables with complete data\n",
    "- Missing values in secondary variables don't impact core analysis\n",
    "- Preserves real-world data patterns\n",
    "\n",
    "**Detected Outliers:**\n",
    "- Extreme charging durations may represent legitimate use cases\n",
    "- Outliers provide insights into edge cases for advertising strategy\n",
    "- Physical constraints applied during modeling phase\n",
    "\n",
    "**Conclusion:**\n",
    "This approach maintains data integrity while focusing on high-quality variables for reliable business insights.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Scalability and Comparative Analysis:**\n",
